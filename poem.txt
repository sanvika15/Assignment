In the heart of time, a leap appears,
A year that dances beyond the years,
Dividing moments with a graceful sway,
A leap year's charm in the calendar's array.

But not each year can bear this flight,
For some march on with steady might,
No leap for them, just steady pace,
In the chronicles of time's embrace.

Thus, in this dance of days and years,
Some leap, some linger, as it appears,
Yet in each beat of time's sweet song,
Life finds its rhythm, both short and long.
